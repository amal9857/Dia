# FIX FOR "Hello from Flask!" ERROR

## The issue: PythonAnywhere is using default Flask template instead of your files

## SOLUTION - Follow these exact steps:

### STEP 1: Go to PythonAnywhere Web Tab
1. Login to https://www.pythonanywhere.com (username: Diaaa)
2. Click "Web" tab

### STEP 2: Fix the WSGI Configuration File
1. Find "Code:" section
2. Click the WSGI configuration file link (looks like: /var/www/diaaa_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py)
3. You'll see a file editor open

### STEP 3: Replace ALL Content
DELETE EVERYTHING in that file and paste ONLY this:

import sys
import os

project_home = '/home/Diaaa/Dia'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)

from flask_app import app as application

### STEP 4: Save and Reload
1. Click "Save" button (top right)
2. Go back to Web tab
3. Click green "Reload diaaa.pythonanywhere.com" button
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Open: https://diaaa.pythonanywhere.com

## If still showing "Hello from Flask!":

### Check Source Code Path:
1. In Web tab, find "Source code:" section
2. Make sure it shows: /home/Diaaa/Dia
3. If not, click "Edit" and change it to: /home/Diaaa/Dia

### Verify Working Directory:
1. In Web tab, find "Working directory:" section  
2. Set it to: /home/Diaaa/Dia

### Then Reload again

## ALTERNATIVE FIX - Delete and Recreate:

If above doesn't work:

1. In Web tab, scroll to bottom
2. Click "Delete web app" (red button)
3. Confirm deletion
4. Click "Add a new web app"
5. Choose "Manual configuration"
6. Select "Python 3.10"
7. In WSGI file, paste the code from STEP 3 above
8. Set Source code to: /home/Diaaa/Dia
9. Add static file mappings:
   - /images → /home/Diaaa/Dia/images
   - /videos → /home/Diaaa/Dia/videos
10. Reload

Your site should now show the actual DIA content!
